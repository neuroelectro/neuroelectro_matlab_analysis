Description:

Readme for analyzing code from Tripathy et al 20XX

The code for running analyses and generating figures from paper are
primarily contained in file: ephys_fig_gen_runfile.m, which is a script file
that calls additional functions and scripts to generate figures.

Run the code in ephys_fig_gen_runfile.m block by block to generate analyses and figures.

The required data for Figure 6 (gene expression figure) is not available 
due to Github limitations on file sizes.  Contact SJT for these files.
